# Plotly Deployment

## Overview of Project

In this project, we were instructed to create a website in which we provide demographic information as well as visualization of a large database of bacterial species. This website is interactive, the user gets to choose the Id they want to look at and the website will provide the following information:

 - The Demographic information of the Test Subject Id
 - A bar chart of the Top ten Bacteria Cultures Found
 - A gauge chart of the Belly Button Washing Frequency 
 - A Bubble Chart of the Bacteria Cultures Per Sample

Each time the user chooses another ID, the graphs will change as well as the information. This project was made in an attempt to prove the hypothesis that there exist a  bacteria found in humans that could bring us closer to the taste of beef.

*** I couldn't figure out how to submit both links so here is the link to the website: https://danira98.github.io/Plotly_deployment/ ***
